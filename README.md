Overview

In this project I aim to create a recommendation system for the IBM Watson community. The recommendation system suggests articles for users to interact.
Features

The recommender system can make recommendations in a number of ways:

    Collaborative Filtering

        Takes into account the similarity of users and recommends the most popular articles read by similar users

    Rank Based Recommendations

        Recommends the highest ranked articles starting with the most highly ranked

    Content Based Filtering

        Produces recommendations based on similarity to material the user has interacted with previously. Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodology to analyse and rank articles by similarity.

    SVD - Matrix Factorization Recommendations

        Utilises matrix operations to predict the ranking (or in this case the boolean interaction variable)
